# Create a new object type called Sample

class Sample:
    pass

x = Sample()

print(type(x))
'''By convention we give classes a name that starts with a capital letter. 
   Note how x is now the reference to our new instance of a Sample class. 
   In other words, we instantiate the Sample class.

   Inside of the class we currently just have pass. But we can define class attributes and methods.'''
